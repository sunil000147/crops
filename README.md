## Description

The Crop Yield Prediction App predicts the expected yield for a specific farm based on inputs provided by the user. It uses machine learning models to analyze various farm conditions, including:
- Crop Type
- Irrigation Type
- Fertilizer Usage
- Pesticide Usage
- Farm Area
- Water Usage

This app is built using Streamlit and can be deployed on any platform that supports Python-based web apps.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit** - for creating the web application.
- **pandas** - for data handling and manipulation.
- **joblib** - for loading the pre-trained machine learning models.
- **scikit-learn** - for the machine learning models used for prediction.

## Setup

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sunil000147/crops.git
